# LockShield
The user first uses lockshield to generate a random image. The user then writes the data which he/she wants to hide. Then the user can click hide data, the image steganography algo uses LSB approach to hide the text in the image using its least significant bits, so that it doesn’t distorts the image

Motivation
The review of the papers is done to get proposed enlightenment about the analysis
done to perceive the idea to build a full-fledged project for client-side encryption
and data storage techniques. This review is also done in order to expand our preexisting knowledge about data encryption techniques and cloud storage capabilities
and also with respect to gaining more insights on how things work in the cloud.

Problem Definition
Breaches are ever rising, and millions of accounts get hacked everyday because of
either less secured passwords or the ability of hackers cracking an account. There
are sensitive data uploaded on the cloud every day, which might be at a risk. The
idea is to create a client-side encryption application and a cloud storage platform
where the client can encrypt the data before uploading it to the cloud, so that even if
the account gets hacked, the data remains secured

Objectives
• To develop a cloud storage application
• To develop a client-side application for encrypting data
• To provide ease of access to implement image steganography

The proposed system of our project which contains various modules. The user first uses lockshield (client-side application) to generate a random image. The user then writes the data which he/she wants to hide (for eg. Credit card details). Then the user can click hide data, the image steganography algorithm uses LSB approach to hide the text in the image using its least significant bits, so that it doesn’t distorts the image. Once the image has been encrypted the user can save it on his/her local machine.


System Design

The architectural block diagram is as shown, the user can access our front- end which contains both the client-side application and cloud storage system. The cloud storage system is deployed in Django and the database is native to django. In the back-end the user accesses our application in which he/she can generate an image and apply image steganography algorithm

Working

The working can be visualized in the following flowchart. Firstly, the user can either select and image or generate an image whichever suits his/her needs.
Then the text is written in the text box provided in the application where the user can insert whatever the data the user wants to encrypt. If the user wants to see the encrypted data then the user can upload the image and click show data tab.

4.2	Modules used for implementation
•	Stegano
For implementation stegano library in python is used to hide the text in the image which is either uploaded or generated by the user. Stegano uses LSB approach which is excellent because it replaces the least significant bits in the image, rendering the image which little to no distortion

•	Matplotlib
Since the application is using the generated image to be shown in the app, mathplotlib serves as a way of providing graph. It is used for creating comprehensive visualization which is helpful as our project utilizes it

•	Randimage
RandImage which generates random images. The application utilizes it in such a way that it generates random images on a single click of the user. It also helps to quickly provide an abstract image.
